   for x in "Python":
        print(x)

    for x in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
        print(x)

    for x in range(5)  # when calling range and 5 you will get numbers 0-4 

    for x in range(0, 10, 2)  # when calling this it will give you the numbers 0-10 in increments of 2

# range objects are iterable like string and lists giving us the capablity to use them in for loops
